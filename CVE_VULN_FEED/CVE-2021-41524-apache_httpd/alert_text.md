A flaw was found in Apache HTTP Server where an attacker 
could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files 
outside the expected document root.

If files outside of the document root are not protected by 
"require all denied" these requests can succeed. 

This issue is known to be exploited in the wild.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not 
earlier versions.
