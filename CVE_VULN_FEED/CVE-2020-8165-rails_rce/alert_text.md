a critical vuln in Rails had been reported that may lead
to RCE when using  MemCacheStore or RedisCacheStore. 
Applications that do not use the raw option when storing 
untrusted user input are not affected.

Since Rails is base of many Webapplications (Redmine, Gitlab) 
the vendors of these applications might issue additional advisories.
