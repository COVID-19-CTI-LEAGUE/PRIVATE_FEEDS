The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
issued Emergency Directive 21-01, in response to a known compromise 
involving SolarWinds Orion products that are currently being exploited 
by malicious actors. 

This Emergency Directive calls on all federal civilian agencies to review 
their networks for indicators of compromise and disconnect or power down 
SolarWinds Orion products immediately.  

The compromise of SolarWindsâ€™ Orion Network Management Products poses 
unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks.
