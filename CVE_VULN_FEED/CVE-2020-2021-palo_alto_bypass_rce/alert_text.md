Palo Alto issued an advisory (CVE-2020-2021)
with a critical vulnerability (CVSS 10) for
it's GlobalProtect/VPNGateways, PAN-OS Firewalls
and Authentication-Portals

from the Advisory: 

When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is 
enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is 
disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS 
SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker 
to access protected resources. 

Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are:

- GlobalProtect Gateway,
- GlobalProtect Portal,
- GlobalProtect Clientless VPN,
- Authentication and Captive Portal,
- PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces,
- Prisma Access

FalsePositive-Remarks:

the list below will include any IP protected by a PaloAlto  GlobalProtect Gateway,
thus include more hits than actual gateways. but if there are hits, there
is a high certainty that a GlobalProtect Gateway is used in your network.

please pass this information to responsible tech/firewall/network - department.
