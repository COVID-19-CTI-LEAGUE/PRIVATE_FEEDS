Cisco released an advisory for it's products using IOS XE (see below) 
with a critical vuln in telnetd, leading to RCE (CVE-2020-10188, CVSS 9.8)

Affected are some procutlines like Catalyst-Switches, 
Edgerouters (ASR 10XX, ASR 900) or branchrouters

FP-Notice: while we can find lots of IOS-Devices

it is IOS-XE or any of the affected products,
so beware of False-Positives.
