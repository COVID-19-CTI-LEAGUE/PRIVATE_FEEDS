Critical vulnerability exists in ActiveMQ, leading possibly to 
unauth-access and RCE

Desc: A regression has been introduced in the commit preventing JMX re-bind. 
By passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map 
that contains the authentication credentials, it leaves ActiveMQ open to the 
following attack: "A remote client could create a custom MBean and use it to 
create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no security manager. 
In other words, a rogue remote client could make your Java application execute arbitrary code." 

Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.13
