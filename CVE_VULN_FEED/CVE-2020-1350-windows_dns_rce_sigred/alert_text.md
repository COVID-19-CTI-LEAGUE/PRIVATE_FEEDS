A remote code execution vulnerability exists in
Windows Domain Name System servers when they fail
to properly handle requests. An attacker who
successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the Local System
Account. Windows servers that are configured as DNS
servers are at risk from this vulnerability.

Affected are all versions from 2003 until recent,
mitigations exists and can be applied before testing

a very brief analysis:
- mitigation available, sufficient, and can applied easily
  before patching
- exploits expected soon, within 7 days
- NOT a single-request-RCE, so probably not exploitable by a single Email/Phish
