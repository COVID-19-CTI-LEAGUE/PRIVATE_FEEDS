We conducted an exchange-backdoor-scan against
all exchange-IPs who found to be online in
early march; IOCs used came from CISA, Microsoft
and private sources, but had been verified.


we found various IPs in your ORG/ASN,
matching criteria for possible vulnerable/infected 
systems


False-Positive-Level: possible, but rare


please find a list of affected IPs below
and more information on that problem here:
